# go.bARk

**A casual Augmented Reality game for you and your virtual dog!**

go.Bark is the brainchild of betsyg6, mkcrumpton, and leslie-meng. We wanted to create a simple game for those of us who either do not have the pleasure of owning a dog, or would like to play with a virtual one in our own homes.

go.bARk aims to allow several different kinds of user/dog interaction, as well as user/user interaction in the forms of in-game friends.

**_Current Status_**

[x] User can toss ball to dog and dog will animate and return ball.
[x] User/Dog interaction generates points, which both appear numerically and visually in the form of a heart meter in the menu.

**_Upcoming Features_**
[ ] User will be able to feed their dog and obtain points.
[ ] User will be able to walk their dog. - [ ] Walking dog can utilize real-world views OR in-game portal views.
[ ] User can take screenshots of their dog and view them in a gallery.

**_Additional Ideas_**

- more friend interactions
- spend points in a store
- more dog games :)
