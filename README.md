# go.bARk

**A casual Augmented Reality game for you and your virtual dog!**

go.Bark is the brainchild of betsyg6, mkcrumpton, and leslie-meng. We wanted to create a simple game for those of us who either do not have the pleasure of owning a dog, or would like to play with a virtual one in our own homes.

go.bARk aims to allow several different kinds of user/dog interaction, as well as user/user interaction in the form of in-game friends.
